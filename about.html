        <h2><i>About</i></h2>
        <p align="justify"> 
Windsor is a city in southwestern Ontario, Canada, on the south bank of the 
Detroit River directly across from Detroit, Michigan, United States. 
Geographically located within but administratively independent of Essex County, 
it is the southernmost city in Canada and marks the southwestern end of the Quebec City
–Windsor Corridor. The city's population was 229,660 at the 2021 census, 
making it the third-most populated city in Southwestern Ontario, 
after London and Kitchener. The Detroit–Windsor urban area is
 North America's most populous trans-border conurbation,
and the Ambassador Bridge border crossing is 
the busiest commercial crossing on the Canada–United States border.
Windsor is a major contributor to Canada's automotive 
industry and is culturally diverse. 
Known as the "Automotive Capital of Canada", Windsor's industrial 
and manufacturing heritage is 
responsible for how the city has developed through the years.</p>

<h2><i>History</i></h2>
<p align="justify">
    Windsor was the site of a battle during the 1838 Upper 
    Canada Rebellion. It was attacked by a band 
    of 400 Americans and rebels from Detroit who burned 
    a steamboat and two or three houses before being routed by the local militia.
    Later that year, Windsor also served as a theatre for the Patriot War.

    In 1846, Windsor had a population of about 300. Two 
    steamboats offered service to Detroit. The barracks were still manned. 
    There were various types of tradesmen, a bank agency and a post office.
</p>

<h2><i>Climate</i></h2>
<p align="justify">
    Windsor has a humid continental climate with four distinct seasons.
    Among cities in Ontario, Windsor has the warmest climate.
    The mean annual temperature is 9.9 °C (50 °F), 
    among the warmest in Canada primarily due to its hot summers. 
    Some locations in coastal and lower mainland British Columbia have 
    a slightly higher mean annual temperature due to milder winter conditions there.
     The coldest month is January and the warmest month is July.
      The coldest temperature ever recorded in Windsor was −32.8 °C (−27.0 °F) on January 
      29, 1873and the warmest was 40.2 °C (104.4 °F) on June 25, 1988.

<h2><i>Cityscape</i></h2>
<p align="justify">
Ouellette Avenue is the historic main commercial street in downtown Windsor. 
It runs north–south, perpendicular to the Detroit River, and divides the city 
into east and west sections. Roads that cross Ouellette Avenue include the directional
 components East and West after their names. Address numbers on east–west roads in Windsor
  increase by 100 for each block travelled away from Ouellette Avenue and address numbers 
  on north–south roads increase by 100 for each block travelled away from the Detroit River.
   In areas where the river curves, some numbers on north–south roads are skipped. 
   For consistency across the city, all address numbers on north–south roads reset at either 600,
    for streets west of Walker Road, or 800 for those to the east, where the road crosses 
    Wyandotte Street.
